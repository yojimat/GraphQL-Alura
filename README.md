# GraphQL Alura
This repository was created to learn along with the course of GraphQL at [Alura](https://www.alura.com.br/).  

## How to use  
At the root directory use ``npx json-server --watch api/data/dados.json`` to get a data server where you can get data from.  
And `npm start` to start the nodemon server that starts the GraphQL server.

## Endpoints  
- http://localhost:3000/users
- http://localhost:3000/roles
